# drugstorehtmlcssjs
simple homepage of a non-realistic drugstore for fun purposes w/ html, css and js. 
you will have to add your own images, remember to edit href, img src, alt, names, descriptions and css if u need it.
a little help: i used freepik for my images, nunito for my font and font-awesome for icons.
